### Use of AI

#### 1. Did you use AI to help create your app? If so, how? Be specific.
Yes, we used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to help create our app. Specifically, we utilized these AI tools to debug errors and resolve logic issues in our code. They provided suggestions and code snippets that improved our development efficiency and helped us overcome technical challenges.

#### 2. Did you use AI to create data sets or clean data sets? If so, how? Be specific.
No, our AI tools were not used to create or clean data sets. The dataset management was handled manually and through our own scripts.

#### 3. Does your app use AI? If so, how? Be specific.
Currently, our app does not have any built-in AI functionality. However, in the future, we plan to integrate AI to recommend protection services to users based on their needs and usage patterns.

#### 4. Did you encounter any limitations? What were they, and how did you overcome them? Be specific.
Yes, we encountered several limitations while using AI tools. One major issue was that the AI did not always provide working code. To overcome this, we had to manually write and debug the code suggested by the AI. This process involved testing different approaches and refining the AI-generated code until it met our requirements.
